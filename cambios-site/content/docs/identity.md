This document captures the design thinking behind CambiOS identity — what identity means in CambiOS, how it relates to files, keys, biology, and social context, and what gets built in what order. It is a living design document, not a specification. When implementation decisions are made, this document gets updated to reflect them.

For the foundational security architecture this plugs into, see [Security](/docs/security/). The filesystem object model that depends on identity is a forthcoming companion doc.

---

## The Core Claim

In CambiOS, everything is an object with an attributable source. Files are signed artifacts with a creator and an owner. Messages are assertions made by an identity. Processes run under an identity with tokenized capabilities.

Identity is primitive and the system is built on that.

---

## What Identity Is Not

Briefly:

**It is not a username.** A human-readable label assigned by a central authority can be reassigned, revoked, or duplicated across systems. CambiOS has no username system.

**It is not password based.** Passwords are shared secrets too easily stolen, leaked, or forgotten. CambiOS has no password authentication.

**It is not an account.** Accounts exist in someone else's database, are granted by an authority, can be suspended, and cease to exist when the service does.

**It is not a certificate from a CA.** Certificate authorities can be compromised, coerced, or simply disappear. CambiOS does not delegate trust to any claimed authority.

**It is not singular.** A human is not a single Principal. A human holds many Principals — one per context, relationship, or session — held in a local vault. Each Principal is its own atomic origin; the system never sees them as facets of a unified identity. The "many" is structural, not a feature added later. Privacy follows from this: observers see the Principal in front of them, never the human behind it.

---

## Authentication vs. Identity

Daily access vs. identity establishment.

Daily use should be frictionless. The user authenticates to their **vault** (biometric, hardware key, or a combination — see [The Vault](#the-vault) below); the vault selects which Principal each newly-spawned process should act under. Identity establishment — generating a new Principal, witnessing an enrollment, recovering a lost vault — is ceremonial and explicit. The two paths share machinery but are distinct in the user experience.

---

## What Identity Is

A CambiOS identity is an irrevocable cryptographic key pair, generated locally, controlled exclusively by its holder, verifiable by anyone, and dependent on no external authority for its existence. The identity layer is **algorithm-agnostic** — all key material, signatures, and verification are mediated through dynamic-sized fields so the system can transition between classical and post-quantum schemes without structural changes.

The identity primitive itself, however, is a **fixed 32-byte AID (Autonomic Identifier)** — separate from the underlying key bytes. This is the load-bearing decision: the AID is what identifies a Principal, the keys are what authenticate signatures *from* that Principal, and the two are decoupled so keys can rotate or change algorithm without changing the identity. See [ADR-025](/adr/025-principal-as-aid/) for the full ratification.

```
Principal {
    aid:          [u8; 32],            // KERI-style identifier — fixed 32 bytes, stable across rotations
    // The AID is computed once at inception:
    //   v1:    aid = ed25519_public_key_bytes  (no key event log yet)
    //   v1.5+: aid = blake3(key_event_log_inception_block)
}

Identity {  // resolved at verify time via the vault (post-v1)
    algorithm:    SignatureAlgorithm,   // which scheme produced the current key
    public_key:   Vec<u8>,              // dynamic-sized — 32 bytes (Ed25519) to 1952 bytes (ML-DSA-65)
    // private_key never stored in this struct — lives in the vault
}

enum SignatureAlgorithm {
    Ed25519,                  // classical: 32-byte keys, 64-byte signatures
    MlDsa65,                  // post-quantum: FIPS 204 (ML-DSA-65, formerly Dilithium3)
    Hybrid(Box<[SignatureAlgorithm; 2]>),  // dual-mode: both must verify
}
```

The AID is the identity. Anyone who knows your AID can ask for the current verification key and check that data was signed by you. No one who lacks the corresponding private key can produce a valid signature. There is no enrollment, no approval, no account creation. Generating the key pair (and recording the inception event) is the act of creating the identity.

In **v1**, the vault is implicit — the AID bytes coincide with an Ed25519 public key, so resolution is the identity function. In **v1.5+**, key rotation and algorithm migration become first-class: the AID stays fixed; the vault's mapping changes. Existing signed artifacts continue to validate because the AID-to-key-history chain is preserved in the rotation log.

In **dual mode**, a signature is the concatenation of a classical Ed25519 signature and a post-quantum ML-DSA-65 signature. Both must verify independently. This provides security against classical attackers today and quantum attackers in the future — an attacker must break *both* schemes to forge a signature.

### Plurality is the default

A human holds many Principals. Each is its own AID, with its own keys, its own signatures, its own scope of use. The vault — a userspace service, local to the user's device — is the only place where these Principals are grouped under a single human. The kernel never holds this grouping; observers never see it. The link between "this human" and "this set of Principals" exists in exactly one place, by construction.

This is the privacy posture. CambiOS doesn't make users anonymous; it makes them plural. An observer holding a Principal sees a 32-byte AID and the artifacts that AID has authored or signed. They cannot reverse it to a human identity, and they cannot link it to other Principals the same human holds, because the linking information lives only in the user's vault.

### Three layers, separate

Identity in CambiOS lives at three architectural layers, and they should be kept distinct:

| Layer | What it knows | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Vault** (userspace, on-device) | Many Principals belong to this human | Selects which Principal a newly-spawned process binds to; holds private keys; gates with biometric/hardware unlock |
| **Per-Principal** (within one identity) | One Principal, with its own keys | Signs, verifies, derives scoped sub-keys for processes via KDF; rotates keys; publishes revocation/rotation proofs |
| **Kernel** (the OS itself) | One process, one bound Principal | Stamps `sender_principal` on IPC; transcribes the Principal onto authored objects; never reasons about plurality |

The boundary between the vault layer and the kernel layer is the **spawn syscall**. The parent process consults the vault (`bind_for_spawn(context)` returns a Principal); the kernel binds the new process to that single Principal; the kernel does not know the vault exists. Plurality lives entirely above the kernel.

### Kernel transcribes; never interprets in the hot path

The kernel's role with identity is **transcription**, not interpretation. It reads the bound Principal from process state, copies it onto outgoing IPC messages, stamps it onto authored objects, and stores it in audit events. It does not branch on Principal values to make policy decisions. Capability checks key on `ProcessId` and a handle table; they do not consult the Principal.

This is the verification posture: any kernel hot-path code that branches on a Principal value violates an invariant. The places where the kernel *does* interpret identity — signature verification at object authorship, bind-stability enforcement, bootstrap-Principal vestiges (being moved to capabilities per [ADR-023](/adr/023-audit-consumer-capability/)) — are at boundary operations (boot, cap promotion, object ingress), where they're already cheap to be expensive.

There is one carve-out: **mechanical set-membership at user-defined ingress boundaries** is permitted. A block list, expressed as a set of denied Principals, checked O(1) on every message receive, is set-membership — not policy adjudication. The kernel decides ∈/∉, not "should this Principal be allowed." That distinction is load-bearing for the [Revocation Model](#revocation-model-boundary-anchored-locally-convergent) section below.

### Capability shape duality

Identity richness shows up in capabilities through a structural duality. Caps have two forms:

| Internal cap (kernel ring, hot path) | External cap (boundary, cold path) |
|---|---|
| `Capability { endpoint, rights }` — table entry in `ProcessCapabilities` | Sub-Principal + scope + lineage + (future) non-revocation witness |
| Bitfield check, ~ns (linear scan over `[Option<Capability>; 32]`) | Cryptographic check, ~μs |
| Identity is a process-level field, not embedded in the cap | Cap carries its own identity richness |
| Revocation: TTL or atomic table mutation | Revocation: accumulator update / witness staleness |

Internal caps are what processes use during their lifetime — looked up dozens of times per syscall, in the IPC hot path, where every nanosecond compounds. External caps are what travel: stored alongside persistent objects, handed across process or device boundaries, restored after restart. The kernel never holds the rich form. It receives an external cap at promotion (grant, restore, attach) — verifies it once, expensively — and installs the corresponding internal handle. It emits external caps at delegation. Inside the ring, only handles.

This is the same shape as control IPC versus channels ([ADR-005](/adr/005-ipc-primitives/)): hot-path messages are kernel-mediated and per-byte-checked; channel data flows through the MMU after a single kernel-mediated setup. The cap layer applies the same posture.

### Quantum-Resistant Dual-Mode Design

CambiOS does not bet on a single cryptographic assumption surviving the next several decades. The identity layer operates in three modes, selectable per identity and upgradeable over time:

| Mode | Algorithm | Public Key | Signature | Use Case |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Classical** | Ed25519 | 32 bytes | 64 bytes | Bootstrap, lightweight devices, backward compatibility |
| **Post-Quantum** | ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) | 1952 bytes | 3293 bytes | Maximum quantum resistance, post-transition |
| **Hybrid** | Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 | 1984 bytes | 3357 bytes | Transition period — secure against both classical and quantum attack |

Hybrid mode is the **default for new identities**. Classical mode remains available for constrained environments and is the bootstrap default until the post-quantum implementation stabilizes.

### Why These Algorithms

**Ed25519** is the classical foundation:

- **Small keys** — 32 bytes public, 32 bytes private. Efficient to store, transmit, and embed in file metadata.
- **Small signatures** — 64 bytes. Minimal overhead for ownership proof.
- **Fast** — Verification is cheap enough to do on every file access without measurable overhead.
- **Constant-time** — Resistant to timing side-channel attacks.
- **Foundation of `did:key`** — The DID method most aligned with CambiOS's no-central-authority principle encodes Ed25519 keys directly.
- **Mature and audited** — Decades of deployment, well-understood security properties.

**ML-DSA-65** (NIST FIPS 204, formerly Dilithium3) is the post-quantum layer:

- **Lattice-based** — Security reduces to Module Learning With Errors (MLWE), believed hard for both classical and quantum computers.
- **NIST standardized** — FIPS 204 finalized August 2024. Not experimental — production-grade standard.
- **Reasonable sizes** — Among post-quantum signature schemes, ML-DSA has the best balance of key size, signature size, and verification speed. 1952-byte public keys and 3293-byte signatures are large compared to Ed25519 but tractable for an OS that controls its own storage format.
- **Fast verification** — ~0.5ms on modern hardware. Acceptable for file access verification, especially with caching.
- **No trusted setup** — Unlike some ZKP-based approaches, lattice signatures require no ceremony or shared state.

### Dynamic-Sized Field Space

All structures that carry keys or signatures use **length-prefixed dynamic fields** rather than fixed-size arrays. This is a deliberate architectural choice:

```
SignedField {
    algorithm:  SignatureAlgorithm,  // identifies the scheme
    length:     u32,                 // byte length of the data field
    data:       [u8],               // key or signature bytes, algorithm-dependent size
}
```

This means:

- **No recompilation on algorithm change.** Switching from Ed25519 to Hybrid does not change struct layouts, file formats, or IPC message formats.
- **Mixed-algorithm ecosystems work.** A file signed with Ed25519 and a file signed with ML-DSA-65 coexist in the same filesystem. Verifiers dispatch on the algorithm tag.
- **Future algorithms slot in.** If NIST standardizes a superior scheme (e.g., SLH-DSA for hash-based fallback, or a future lattice improvement), it becomes a new variant of `SignatureAlgorithm` with no structural changes.
- **Wire format is self-describing.** A signed object carries enough information to verify itself without external schema knowledge.

The 32-byte AID stays fixed across all modes — algorithm-agnosticism applies to keys and signatures, not to the identity tag itself. See [ADR-025](/adr/025-principal-as-aid/) and [ADR-005](/adr/005-ipc-primitives/) for the load-bearing reasoning.

## The Vault

The vault is a userspace service that holds the user's Principals. It is the answer to "where do private keys live, and how do they map to running processes?"

In v0–1B, the vault is implicit — the bootstrap private key sits in a kernel static, signing happens in the host-side `sign-elf` tool, and there is no runtime key management. **Phase 1C** (below) is where the vault becomes a real service, extending the existing `key-store-service` slot at endpoint 17.

### What the vault holds

```
Vault {
    principals:    Vec<VaultEntry>,             // many, by design
    unlock_state:  TransientUnlockMaterial,     // never persisted in plaintext
    context_map:   HashMap<ContextLabel, AID>,  // local-only "social_app → Principal_X"
}

VaultEntry {
    aid:                 [u8; 32],
    encrypted_keys:      Vec<u8>,        // sealed at rest under the vault key
    inception_record:    Option<...>,    // KERI-style provenance, post-v1
    rotation_history:    Vec<...>,       // append-only, post-v1
}
```

The vault encrypts every Principal's private key material at rest. The vault key is itself derived from the user's biometric + device entropy + (post-Phase 3) social attestation — see [The Biological Identity Model](#the-biological-identity-model) below. Unlock material is transient: derived per session, used to decrypt the entries the user actually invokes, wiped at session end.

### How processes get a Principal

Spawning is the identity-transition primitive. The parent process consults the vault before invoking spawn:

```
parent → vault.bind_for_spawn(context_label) → Principal P
parent → spawn(elf, principal=P)
kernel → binds new process to P; the rest of its lifetime uses P
```

The kernel learns nothing about the vault. It receives "spawn this child as Principal P" and treats P as opaque 32 bytes to transcribe forward. From the kernel's view, plurality does not exist — every process is bound to one Principal at the moment of creation, and stays bound for life.

Want to act as a different Principal? Spawn a different process. The process is the unit of identity in CambiOS. There is no "switch Principal mid-execution" syscall and there will not be — that would put a policy decision (which identity am I now?) inside the kernel ring, which is the wrong place for it.

### Why this is the privacy story

The human↔Principals mapping exists in exactly one place: the vault, on the user's device, in volatile memory while unlocked, encrypted at rest. It does not exist in the kernel. It does not exist on disk in plaintext. It does not exist in any observer's view.

A cloud service that talks to one of your Principals sees that Principal's AID and that Principal's signed artifacts. A different cloud service talking to a different one of your Principals sees a different AID and a different set of artifacts. The two cloud services cannot link them — the link is held only by you, locally.

This is anonymity-from-plurality, not anonymity-from-absence. You are not anonymous to the system you're using; you're anonymous *across* systems. Multi-Principal-by-default makes correlation attacks fail by construction, not by policy.

### What the vault is *not*

- **Not an aggregating identity.** There is no "vault Principal" that signs on behalf of the others. Each Principal in the vault is its own atomic origin. The vault is bookkeeping.
- **Not a kernel concept.** The kernel never knows the vault exists. The cap that grants access to the vault is held by userspace, like any other userspace capability.
- **Not a singleton.** A user may have multiple vaults (one per device), synchronized via per-Principal CRDT replication. Cross-device sync is local-first and end-to-end encrypted; no server holds vault state.
- **Not the same service as init.** [ADR-018](https://github.com/coherentforge/cambios/blob/main/docs/adr/018-init-process-and-boot-manifest.md) supervises boot-time service lifecycle; the vault is the identity selector. They cooperate (init may consult the vault when spawning manifest entries) but are different services.

## Identity and Files

The decision that files have owners is the decision that shapes everything above it.

A file in CambiOS's native format is not bytes with a path. It is:

```
File {
    content:          [u8],
    creator:          SignedField,        // who made this — IMMUTABLE, set at creation
    owner:            SignedField,        // who controls this — transferable
    signature:        SignedField,        // owner's signature (dynamic-sized)
    capabilities:     CapabilitySet,      // who can do what with this file
    lineage:          Option<ObjectHash>, // what was this derived from?
    created_at:       Timestamp,
    content_hash:     Blake3Hash,         // integrity, separate from signature
}
```

**Creator** is the identity that brought the object into existence. It is set at creation and never changes — it is historical fact. **Owner** is the identity that currently controls the object. At creation, the creator is the owner. Ownership can be transferred; creatorship cannot.

This is the canonical **cold-path identity-rich** artifact. Files travel: across processes, across devices, across humans. They outlive their creating processes. They survive reboots. They cannot rely on anyone's process being alive to vouch for them. So they carry full identity richness intrinsically — author Principal, owner Principal, signature, lineage. The cost (signature verification on each load) is paid at the boundary the file crosses, not in any hot path.

An employee creates a document at work — they are the creator, the employer is the owner. An independent contractor creates a document — they are both creator and owner unless a contract transfers ownership. The distinction matters: creatorship is provenance (who made this), ownership is authority (who controls this).

The owner signs the object. The signature ties content to controller cryptographically. Stripping the owner field invalidates the signature. You cannot forge ownership. You can only derive a new file with yourself as owner, and the lineage field traces back to the original.

### Per-Principal isolation

Files authored by one of your Principals are owned by that Principal. They are not implicitly shared with your other Principals — even though you, the human, are behind both. Sharing across your own Principals (because you, the human, are working in different contexts and want to move content between them) is an **explicit grant**, like sharing with another human.

This sounds severe but it is the right default. The whole point of multi-Principal is that the system never knows which Principals belong to the same human. If `social_Principal` could implicitly access `banking_Principal`'s files, the link would have to live somewhere queryable — defeating the privacy story. Instead, the user explicitly bridges contexts when they want to. The vault makes this easy in the UI; the architecture keeps it explicit.

### Ownership Transfer

Ownership is transferred via a signed `OwnershipTransfer` object — itself a CambiObject stored in the ObjectStore:

```
OwnershipTransfer {
    object_hash:      Blake3Hash,        // the object being transferred
    from_owner:       SignedField,       // current owner (signs this transfer)
    to_owner:         SignedField,       // new owner
    signature:        SignedField,       // current owner's signature over this transfer
    terms:            Option<TransferTerms>,  // negotiated conditions (finex)
    created_at:       Timestamp,
}
```

Every ownership change is a signed, content-addressed object. The auditable chain of custody can be independently verified. Ownership transfer is the primitive that higher-level protocols build on: financial exchange, licensing, delegation. Those are userspace protocols, and do not belong in the identity layer, listed here for context. See finex (forthcoming) for the negotiated exchange protocol.

### What This Enables

Provenance is structural. Because the creator field is immutable and ownership verified by signature, attribution cannot be stripped or forged. Forking any document produces a new object with the original hash in lineage — the chain of attribution is permanent and traceable without anyone's cooperation.

Sharing is replication of the same signed artifact, it's not a copy with back-referencing. A file you push to a peer is verifiable as yours regardless of where it lives. A sovereign cloud host stores objects as ciphertext they cannot read, forge, or credibly deny origins of.

The append-only social log is not a separate concept. Each post is a CambiObject. Linking by lineage creates the social log. Commerce is not a separate layer either. The identity primitive provides for the exchange primitive; a userspace finex module builds negotiation, terms, and settlement on top.

## The Biological Identity Model

### The Problem With Keys Alone

A key pair solves the cryptographic problem of identity. It does not solve the human problem of identity: what happens when you lose the keys?

In a pure key-pair model, losing the private keys means losing the identities. Every file you signed becomes unextendable (you can no longer produce new signatures). Recovery requires either a trusted third party (central authority, violates CambiOS principles) or a pre-established recovery mechanism (another secret to lose).

The vault is the per-device home for keys; biological identity is what makes the vault recoverable when the device is lost.

### Biometrics as Entropy, Not as Key

The biological insight is this: **biometric data is not a private key, but it is a powerful entropy source for key derivation.**

You do not sign with your retina. You derive the **vault key** *from* your biometric profile (or a committed representation of it) such that possession of a matching biological sample is required to regenerate the vault key. The vault key in turn protects every Principal's private material at rest. The vault key is never stored; it is derived from things inherent to being alive.

The primary biometric modalities, in order of preference:

1. **Retinal scan**
2. **Facial geometry**
3. **DNA/epigenetic profiling** (future fallback)

```
vault_key = KDF(biometric_commitment, device_context, social_attestation)
```

If you lose your device, you regenerate the vault key from the same inputs. The derived vault key is the same; once unlocked, every Principal in the vault is recoverable. Your identities are continuous.

### Uniqueness and Context Vectors

No single biometric is perfectly unique in isolation. Identical twins have nearly indistinguishable facial geometry at birth. Retinal patterns are unique but could theoretically be spoofed with sufficient technology. The resolution is a **context vector**: identity is derived not from a single measurement but from multiple independent signals that converge on a unique individual.

```
IdentityContext {
    biometric_commitment:  Option<BiometricHash>,    // committed biometric profile (ZKP)
                                                     // retinal scan, facial geometry, or DNA (future)
    device_entropy:        [u8; 32],                 // hardware-bound randomness
    social_attestation:    Option<Vec<Attestation>>, // quorum of trusted contacts
    temporal_proof:        Option<Timestamp>,        // continuity across time
}
```

The biometric modalities, in order of current preference:

1. **Retinal scan** — vascular patterns are distinct even between identical twins (shaped by stochastic developmental processes, not genetics alone). Stable over a lifetime.
2. **Facial geometry** — 3D facial structure diverges with age and life experience. Widely accessible via commodity hardware.
3. **DNA/epigenetic profiling** — held back until social and ethical consensus exists. Slots into the context vector as an additional field once that emerges. **Revisit when:** a published civil-society standard or major identity-protocol acceptance for DNA-as-identity surfaces, or explicit user-base demand makes the question concrete.

Combined with device entropy (hardware-bound) and social attestation (community-bound), the context vector produces a unique vault recoverability story even in adversarial edge cases.

The context vector makes recovery a function of who you are biologically *and* what devices you control *and* what your social context attests.

### Privacy: Zero-Knowledge Proofs

Biometric data is inherently sensitive. A retinal scan reveals the unique vascular structure of your eye. Facial geometry is recognizable. DNA reveals disease predisposition, family relationships, and ancestry. None of this can be exposed in a public registry or embedded in a file header.

The zero-knowledge proof approach resolves this:

```
ZKP: "I possess a biometric sample consistent with the committed profile,
     without revealing the profile itself,
     without revealing which modality was used,
     without revealing anything about my biology beyond the proof."
```

The commitment (a hash of the biometric profile) is public and stored with the identity context. The raw biometric data never leaves the device. Verification is proof of biological consistency, not disclosure of biological data.

This is an active research area (biometric ZKPs). CambiOS does not implement it now. But the interface is designed to accommodate it when it matures.

### Vault Recovery via Biometric Context

Lost vault recovery without a central authority:

```
Recovery protocol:
1. Present fresh biometric sample (retinal scan, facial geometry, or future modality)
2. ZKP proves sample matches committed profile
3. Quorum of trusted social graph contacts attest continuity
   ("this biometric matches the entity we have communicated with")
4. New device derives the vault key from the same IdentityContext inputs
5. Vault entries (all Principals, encrypted) are pulled from the user's
   per-Principal CRDT replicas (other devices, sovereign cloud peers) and
   decrypted with the recovered vault key
6. Compromised individual Principals can be rotated within the recovered
   vault per the per-Principal rotation protocol below
```

The vault key is never stored. It is derived. The derivation inputs are things you are (biology) and people who know you (social graph). Losing them all would be tricky at best.

---

## Social Attestation and DAO/NAO Alignment

### The Social Graph as Identity Infrastructure

CambiOS's SSB-inspired social layer is core identity infrastructure. The append-only signed logs of your peers are a verifiable record of their interaction with you over time. A quorum of peers attesting to your identity is more than a social nicety. It is a cryptographic recovery mechanism.

This maps directly onto DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) governance models: quorum decisions, on-log attestation, authority without central control. A recovery quorum functions like a DAO vote — a threshold of known parties must attest before a vault recovery is authorized.

The NAO framing — Networked/Natural Autonomous Organization — extends this toward biological and social systems as the model for decentralized governance. An identity system grounded in biological context and social attestation is a NAO-native design: authority derives from nature (biology) and community (social graph), not from institutions.

### Enrollment: The Cold-Start Problem

The hardest question in biological identity is the first enrollment. At some point, a biometric sample must be committed for the first time. If that enrollment is compromised, every Principal in the vault that depends on it is compromised from origin.

The proposed resolution is that enrollment is a **witnessed social act**, not a database transaction:

- Existing identities in your social graph witness and attest the enrollment
- The enrollment record is signed by the witnesses and stored in their append-only logs
- A new vault's provenance is traceable to the community that witnessed its creation

A new vault's trust weight reflects the depth and history of its attestation graph — not a binary trusted/untrusted distinction, but a continuous signal that grows with genuine interaction.

This mirrors how human identity has always worked at its most fundamental level: community recognition, not institutional registration. You exist as an identity because people who know you attest to your existence. CambiOS makes this explicit and cryptographic.

Bootstrapping the system requires real human group interaction.

---

## Key Lifecycle

### Generation

Key generation is local. No network required. No authority consulted. Each Principal in the vault is generated independently — generating a new Principal is a vault operation, not a separate ceremony. The `IdentityContext` (biometric + device entropy + social attestation) seeds the vault key, which in turn protects each Principal's private material at rest.

A human typically holds many Principals: one per context, one per relationship, one per service category, possibly ephemeral ones for one-shot interactions. Generating a new Principal is cheap and contextual.

### Storage

Private keys live in the vault. No userspace process other than the vault holds raw private key material. Signing operations are requests to the vault: "sign this data with Principal X." The vault returns the signature; the private key does not leave.

When hardware security modules are available (TPM, Secure Enclave), Principals' private keys live in hardware and signing happens inside the secure element. The vault becomes a thin coordinator between the userspace requester and the hardware. The raw key material is never exposed to software under any circumstances.

### Rotation

Key rotation is per-Principal, not vault-wide. A Principal whose key is compromised rotates; the AID stays fixed; the vault's mapping updates; existing artifacts signed by the old key remain valid through the rotation chain.

The rotation protocol:

1. New key pair generated within the vault, bound to the same AID
2. Recovery quorum attests continuity (biometric + social) for high-value rotations
3. Old public key signs a rotation record pointing to new public key (if old key is still accessible)
4. If old key is inaccessible: quorum attestation alone authorizes rotation, recorded in witnesses' logs
5. New key is the current key for the AID; the rotation proof links the new key to the original identity chain
6. Files signed with old key remain valid — the rotation proof establishes they were made by the same identity

### Delegation to Processes

CambiOS's three-layer identity model maps cleanly onto process delegation:

**Vault layer:** the parent process consults the vault at spawn time. The vault returns a Principal `P` appropriate to the spawn context. Different children of the same parent can be bound to different Principals if the parent (with vault permission) chooses.

**Per-Principal layer:** *within* a Principal `P`, processes can derive scoped sub-keys for fine-grained delegation:

```
process_key = KDF(P_private_key, process_capability_hash, timestamp)
```

A signature from a process's scoped key is verifiable as deriving from `P` without exposing `P`'s root private key to the process. A compromised process under `P` cannot forge `P`'s identity for operations outside its scope. This per-Principal KDF model is the original delegation primitive (preserved from prior versions of this document); it operates *underneath* the vault's multi-Principal selection.

**Kernel layer:** the kernel sees one process, one bound Principal. The bound Principal is the AID stamped onto every IPC message and authored object. The kernel does not see — and does not care — that this Principal is one of many in the user's vault.

## Revocation Model: Boundary-Anchored, Locally-Convergent

CambiOS does not have a central authority that can revoke identities. There is no certificate revocation list, no global kill switch, no admin who can delete you. Revocation is **local**, **social**, and structurally tiered to match the cap-shape duality from [What Identity Is](#what-identity-is): hot-path mechanisms for hot-path caps, cold-path mechanisms for cold-path caps.

There are three distinct mechanisms, serving different purposes.

### Local Blocking (Immediate, Kernel-Enforced, Set-Membership)

Every Principal maintains a **block list** — an immutable, append-only set of Principals that are denied IPC access. When a Principal is blocked, the kernel refuses IPC messages from that sender before they reach the recipient.

The block-list check sits at the IPC ingress boundary — every message receive consults a per-Principal hash set or bloom filter, O(1). Importantly, this is **mechanical set-membership, not policy adjudication.** The kernel decides ∈/∉; it does not branch on the Principal's *value* to make a policy decision about *what kind of identity* this is. The user defines the set; the kernel enforces the membership check. This distinction is what keeps the check compatible with the "kernel transcribes, doesn't interpret" invariant.

Block lists are published to the owner's SSB feed so peers can see who you've blocked, but the enforcement is local. You don't need anyone's permission to block, and no one can force you to unblock.

The block list is stored per-process in the capability manager, not in a global table — blocking is a per-Principal decision, not a system-wide one. A user's `social_Principal` may block someone their `banking_Principal` happily transacts with, because they are different identities making different trust decisions, even though they belong to the same human.

### Capability Revocation (Tiered by Cap Shape)

Beyond IPC blocking, the cap-shape duality implies two revocation paradigms:

**Internal caps (kernel table):** synchronous, kernel-led, push-based revocation. The `revoke()` method atomically removes the capability from the holder's table, issues TLB shootdowns for any associated channel mappings, invalidates per-CPU policy caches, and notifies the holder via control IPC. After `revoke()` returns, no thread on any CPU can use the revoked capability. This is the model specified in [ADR-007](/adr/007-capability-revocation/), and it remains correct for in-kernel caps where the kernel has direct authority over the table.

**External caps (persistent, cross-domain):** asynchronous, holder-led, pull-based via **non-revocation witnesses**. For caps that outlive their issuing process — caps stored alongside CambiObjects, caps handed across device boundaries, caps issued for cross-Principal grants — the kernel cannot reach across boundaries to push a revocation. Instead, the issuer maintains an accumulator (a small constant-size cryptographic structure, published as a CambiObject); cap holders carry witnesses against the accumulator; verification at use checks witness-against-current-accumulator membership. Revocation is an accumulator update — holders converge asynchronously by refreshing their witnesses; revoked holders cannot generate a new witness because their cap was excluded from the new accumulator.

The two paradigms compose. A cap promoted *into* the kernel table from an external presentation is checked once (witness verified, accumulator membership confirmed) and then becomes a fast bearer token until it expires or is explicitly revoked. The cold-path crypto pays for itself at the boundary; the hot-path stays hot. See ADR-007's forthcoming amendment for the full witness-and-accumulator design.

### Revocation Publication (Social, Eventually Consistent)

When a key is compromised or permanently retired, the owner (or their recovery quorum) publishes a signed proof to their append-only SSB feed. There are two types:

**KeyRotationProof** — "My old key is retired; my new key is this one." The old key signs the proof if it's still accessible (see Key Lifecycle > Rotation above). If the old key is lost, the recovery quorum attests the rotation instead. The rotated identity is the *same* identity (same AID) — files signed with the old key remain valid, linked through the rotation chain.

**KeyRevocationProof** — "This key is dead. There is no successor." This is for permanent compromise where the owner cannot or does not wish to rotate. The revocation proof is signed by a quorum of social attestors (since the compromised key itself is untrusted). A revoked key has no continuity — it is a severed identity.

Peers learn about revocations through normal SSB feed replication. When a peer sees a rotation or revocation proof in a feed they follow, they can choose to adopt the block — adding the old key to their own block list. This propagates outward through the social graph: your close contacts learn in seconds, their contacts in minutes, distant nodes over a longer window as replication reaches them.

### The AI Watcher's Role

The AI security service ([ADR-007](/adr/007-capability-revocation/), [Philosophy](/docs/philosophy/)) consumes the audit telemetry stream — IPC patterns, capability denials, channel events, process lifecycle — and detects behavioral anomalies. **The AI does not write policy**, and it does not decide who is allowed to do what. What it does, when it notices an anomaly, is **flag and recommend containment**:

1. AI sees `Principal_X` exhibiting access patterns inconsistent with its history.
2. AI sends a recommendation to the policy service: "Recommend narrowing capability set on `Principal_X`."
3. Policy service evaluates the recommendation against its rules (which may or may not act on AI input — configurable).
4. If the policy service decides to act, it calls `SYS_REVOKE_CAPABILITY`. The kernel performs the mechanical revocation.

The AI never invokes kernel intervention primitives directly. It holds two capabilities — read the audit channel, send recommendations to the policy service — and that is the entirety of its authority. Compromising the AI cannot directly compromise anything; the worst it can do is send bad recommendations, which still have to pass through the policy service.

Critically, **containment is per-Principal**. When the AI flags `social_Principal`, the human's other Principals are untouched. The blast radius of a sandbox event is a context, not a person. This composition with multi-Principal-by-default is what makes "AI watches and contains" usable in practice — narrowing one identity does not disrupt the human's broader work.

### The Bootstrap Principal: A Special Case

The bootstrap Principal is not a person. It is a hardware-backed key (YubiKey root of trust per Phase 0/1B) used to sign kernel processes and boot modules. It cannot be socially revoked because it has no social graph — no SSB feed, no peers, no quorum.

Bootstrap Principal revocation is a **system-level event**: firmware update, new YubiKey provisioning, re-signing of boot modules. It is analogous to rotating a root CA certificate — rare, deliberate, and requires physical or administrative access to the machine. The social revocation model does not apply here, and should not be expected to.

The bootstrap Principal is also outside the vault model — there is one bootstrap Principal per device, not per human, and it does not represent a human at all.

### Properties

| Property | Traditional CA | CambiOS Revocation |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Latency (push)** | Seconds (CRL/OCSP) | Microseconds (kernel revoke for internal caps) |
| **Latency (social)** | N/A | Seconds to minutes (social graph replication) |
| **Latency (witness)** | N/A | Asynchronous (witness staleness window, bounded by refresh policy) |
| **Scope** | Global | Local-first, social, per-Principal |
| **Authority** | Central (CA decides) | Distributed (each peer decides independently) |
| **Censorship resistance** | Low (CA can revoke anyone) | High (revocation is a claim peers evaluate, not a directive) |
| **Scaling cost** | O(n) global list | O(1) per-peer block + O(1) accumulator membership |
| **Offline resilience** | Fails (can't reach OCSP) | Degrades gracefully (local blocks + cached witnesses still work) |

### Why This Is Sufficient

This model trades **instant global revocation** for **layered local revocation with eventual consistency**. The trade is worth it because:

1. **Real-world identity already works this way.** When someone's identity is compromised, you tell the people who matter — your friends, your colleagues, your bank. You don't issue a global broadcast. The people who need to know find out fast; the people who don't need to know find out in due course, or not at all.

2. **The attacker's window is narrow.** An attacker with a stolen key cannot immediately impersonate you to your actual contacts — you notify them through a trusted side channel (in person, phone call, pre-shared signal) and they block instantly. The attacker can only fool strangers who haven't received the revocation yet, and strangers have low trust weight by default.

3. **Central revocation is a central vulnerability.** Any system that can revoke you globally can be coerced, compromised, or corrupted into revoking you unjustly. CambiOS eliminates this attack surface entirely. No single entity — not even the OS itself — can erase your identity from the network.

4. **The three mechanisms are tier-appropriate.** Internal caps need synchronous push (the kernel can do it). Persistent caps need async pull (witnesses against accumulators). Identity-level revocation needs social propagation. Trying to use one mechanism for all three would make some operations too slow and others too brittle. Tiering is honest about the cost structure.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Bootstrap Identity — Hardware-Backed (YubiKey)

The bootstrap identity is the root of trust for the entire system. It uses a **hardware-backed Ed25519 key on a YubiKey** (OpenPGP smart card interface). The private key never leaves the YubiKey hardware — it cannot be extracted via software, memory dumps, or cold boot attacks.

**Build-time signing:** The `sign-elf` tool communicates with the YubiKey to sign boot modules. The YubiKey performs Ed25519 signing internally; the host never sees the private key.

**Compiled-in public key:** The YubiKey's Ed25519 public key is extracted once (`sign-elf --export-pubkey bootstrap_pubkey.bin`) and compiled into the kernel via `include_bytes!`. The kernel uses this key to verify boot module signatures and to restrict identity-binding operations.

**No runtime secret key:** The kernel never holds the bootstrap secret key. Runtime object signing is handled by user-space services with their own operational keys (currently degraded until USB HID enables runtime YubiKey communication).

**Recovery model:** Two YubiKeys — one primary (daily use), one backup (physically separate secure storage). If the primary is lost, the backup can sign a key rotation proof. Vault recovery via biometric + social attestation (Phase 2/3) extends this further.

```rust
// bootstrap_pubkey.bin: 32-byte Ed25519 public key from YubiKey
// Generated by: sign-elf --yubikey --export-pubkey bootstrap_pubkey.bin
const BOOTSTRAP_PUBKEY: &[u8; 32] = include_bytes!("bootstrap_pubkey.bin");
```

The interface it exposes is the permanent interface — algorithm-agnostic, dynamic-sized. The implementation behind it changes. The interface does not.

### Phase 1: Cryptographic Hardening

Real entropy for runtime randomness, signed ELF verification with the bootstrap public key, content-addressed object storage with Blake3 hashes, Ed25519 signature verification on `ObjPut`. See [ADR-004](/adr/004-cryptographic-integrity/) and [ADR-003](/adr/003-content-addressed-storage/) for the details.

### Phase 1.5: Post-Quantum Upgrade

ML-DSA-65 implementation integrated alongside Ed25519. New Principals default to Hybrid mode (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65). Existing Ed25519 Principals can upgrade via key rotation — the rotation proof is dual-signed (old Ed25519 key signs the new Hybrid key, establishing continuity). File verification dispatches on the `SignatureAlgorithm` tag and validates accordingly.

### Phase 1C: Vault Service

The `key-store-service` slot at endpoint 17 (currently degraded — endpoint reserved, no real backend) becomes the **multi-Principal vault**. The architectural slot is the same; what changes is the model.

**Scope:**
- Vault holds N Principals per human, encrypted at rest under the vault key (biometric-derived + device entropy).
- Userspace API exposes `bind_for_spawn(context_label) → Principal` for parent processes consulting the vault before spawn.
- Userspace API exposes `sign_with(principal, data) → Signature` for authored content and IPC handshakes.
- Vault unlock material is transient: derived from biometric/hardware-key input each session, used to decrypt active entries, wiped at session end.
- Cross-device sync uses per-Principal CRDT replication (foundation for Phase 7 SSB bridge); no server holds vault state.
- The `ObjPutSigned` syscall stays the cap-gated "store this pre-signed object" primitive; signing happens in the vault before the syscall is invoked.

**Out of scope (this phase):**
- Runtime YubiKey access from the running kernel (requires USB HID; deferred to post-v1).
- Hardware-backed sealed storage of derived keys (TPM/Secure Enclave integration; long-term).
- Witness-bearing capabilities for cold-path revocation (deferred to ADR-007 amendment).

### Phase 2: Biometric Commitment

ZKP-based biometric commitment. The `IdentityContext.biometric_commitment` field becomes populated with retinal scan (primary) or facial geometry (secondary). Vault key derivation incorporates biological context. Recovery via biometric proof becomes possible.

This requires ZKP infrastructure and biometric scanning integration — future work, but the interface slot exists from Phase 0. DNA/epigenetic profiling may be added as a future modality if social and ethical consensus emerges.

### Phase 3: Social Attestation and Recovery

Social graph quorum recovery. The `social_attestation` field in `IdentityContext` becomes populated from the SSB-inspired social layer. Vault recovery via quorum attestation is implemented. The cold-start enrollment protocol is defined.

### Phase 4: Full DID Integration

`did:key` encoding of identity public keys. Ed25519 keys use the existing `did:key` multicodec. ML-DSA-65 and Hybrid keys use extended multicodec prefixes (pending W3C/IETF standardization of post-quantum DID methods). Identities become expressible as DIDs, interoperable with the broader decentralized identity ecosystem. Cryptographic capabilities across networked CambiOS nodes become possible.

---

## Architectural Invariants

These must hold after every change to identity-related code:

1. **Private keys never leave the vault.** No userspace process other than the vault receives raw private keys. Signing is always a request to the vault.

2. **Every file has a creator and an owner.** The native CambiOS filesystem format has no concept of a creatorless or ownerless file. The creator field is immutable — no API path may modify it after creation. The owner field is transferable only via signed `OwnershipTransfer` objects. Files created by system processes during bootstrap have the bootstrap identity as both creator and owner.

3. **Signatures are verified before trust.** A file's owner field is meaningless without verifying the signature. Code that reads owner without verifying signature is a bug.

4. **Biological data never leaves the device unencrypted.** Biometric commitments are hashes. ZKPs are proofs. Raw biological data is never transmitted, stored remotely, or exposed to any process other than the vault.

5. **Enrollment is witnessed.** The cold-start enrollment protocol requires social attestation. Unwitnessed enrollment is not supported in production — only in bootstrap/development mode, and explicitly labeled as such.

6. **Key rotation preserves lineage.** A rotated identity is the same identity (same AID). Files signed with the old key and files signed with the new key are traceable to the same root through the rotation proof chain.

7. **The kernel transcribes identity in the hot path; it interprets only at boundaries.** Kernel hot-path code (capability checks, IPC stamping, audit emission) must not branch on Principal values to make policy decisions. Mechanical set-membership at user-defined ingress boundaries (block lists) is permitted — set membership is not adjudication. Identity interpretation (signature verification, cap promotion, bootstrap-Principal special cases) happens only at boundary operations where the surrounding context already pays high fixed cost.

8. **A process is bound to exactly one Principal at any moment.** Plurality is a vault property, not a process property. The kernel never holds, receives, or reasons about a "set of Principals" for a single process. To act as a different Principal, spawn a different process.

9. **The human↔Principals mapping never leaves the user's device.** The vault is the only entity that knows which Principals belong to the same human. This link is held in volatile memory while the vault is unlocked, encrypted at rest, and never transmitted in plaintext. Cross-device vault sync is end-to-end encrypted with no server-side knowledge of the mapping.

## Open Questions

These are known unknowns.

Phase 1.5 blockers:

- **ML-DSA-65 `no_std` implementation** — Which Rust crate for ML-DSA-65 works in `no_std` bare-metal? `pqcrypto-dilithium` wraps C; `ml-dsa` (RustCrypto) is pure Rust but may need maturity review. Stack usage for lattice operations on a 256KB boot stack needs measurement.
- **Hybrid signature verification cost** — Dual verification (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65) on every file access approximately doubles CPU cost. Is per-file caching of verification results sufficient, or does hot-path file access need a session-scoped verification bypass?

Vault design questions:

- **Cross-device vault sync substrate.** Per-Principal CRDT replication is the natural model (each Principal owns its log; vault entries replicate per-Principal). Concrete CRDT choice (RGA, Causal Tree, OR-Set with custom merge) deferred until vault implementation begins. **Revisit when:** Phase 1C lands and a second device joins the user's vault.
- **Witness-bearing cap envelope format.** The external cap form sketched in [Capability shape duality](#capability-shape-duality) — sub-Principal + scope + lineage + non-revocation witness — does not yet have a wire/disk format. Deferred to the ADR-007 amendment that lands non-revocation accumulators. **Revisit when:** the first non-FS persistent cap (e.g., a delegated network grant that survives process exit) needs to be serialized.
- **Vault unlock UX under coercion.** Biometric unlock can be compelled. A duress mode (a separate biometric pattern that unlocks a decoy vault while alerting peers) is a real research direction but explicitly deferred. **Revisit when:** a credible threat model surfaces that requires it (e.g., journalist-protection deployment).

Further future unresolved:

- **ZKP library selection** — Which ZKP system is appropriate for biometric proofs? Groth16, PLONK, STARKs? The choice affects proof size, verification time, and trusted setup requirements.
- **Retinal scanning hardware** — What consumer-grade retinal scanning APIs exist? Integration with mobile/desktop hardware (e.g., IR camera arrays). Phase 2 may require partnership with hardware vendors or standardization efforts.
- **Facial geometry stability** — How is aging, injury, or surgical change handled? What is the false rejection rate over a 10-year window? Is periodic re-enrollment needed, and if so, how does that interact with the commitment model?
- **Quorum size and threshold** — How many social attestations are required for vault recovery? What prevents a social engineering attack on the quorum?
- **DNA as future modality** — Under what conditions (social consensus, privacy infrastructure maturity, regulatory clarity) would DNA/epigenetic profiling be activated? What governance mechanism decides this — per-user opt-in, community vote, or protocol-level upgrade?
- **Process key scoping** — How is the `process_capability_hash` computed? What prevents a process from claiming a broader scope than it was granted?
- **Rotation during social graph unavailability** — If a key is lost and the social graph is offline (no network), how is recovery handled? Is there a time-limited local recovery path?
- **Post-quantum DID encoding** — `did:key` multicodec for ML-DSA-65 is not yet standardized. CambiOS may need to define a provisional encoding and migrate when the standard lands. What is the compatibility strategy?
