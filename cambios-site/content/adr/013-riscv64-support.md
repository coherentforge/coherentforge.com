## Context

CambiOS has matured two architecture backends — x86_64 and AArch64 — with a clean abstraction boundary. Roughly 85% of the kernel is portable, the arch-specific 15% lives under `src/arch/<target>/` behind a documented public API contract, and the boot path is fully protocol-agnostic via `BootInfo` (src/boot/mod.rs) — the only piece still tied to Limine is application-processor wakeup.

This ADR commits CambiOS to a third backend, **riscv64gc**, in parallel with Phase 4b. The work is sequenced through Phases R-0 through R-6 in the plan file; this ADR records the architecturally load-bearing decisions made before code lands, so future maintainers (and future Claude sessions) can recover the *why* without rereading every commit.

Three things make now the right time to add a third architecture:

1. **The abstraction boundary works.** Two backends are not enough to validate that a contract is a contract; three are. The exercise of fitting RISC-V into the existing `arch/` and `boot/` shapes will reveal whichever assumptions in those shapes are accidentally x86-or-AArch64-specific. Fixing them now — while the kernel is small — is cheaper than fixing them after a graphics stack, a network stack, and a Windows compatibility layer have all consumed those shapes.
2. **The hardware target is undecided.** Bare-metal CambiOS hardware will be project-designed (per the memory note "Build it to work on hardware we design"). Encoding RISC-V support against a generic standards-compliant target now means future CambiOS hardware inherits a working backend rather than waiting on a port.
3. **Phase 4b is concurrent, not blocking.** The two streams touch disjoint code: 4b is persistent storage and a Phase 4a follow-up; RISC-V is `arch/` plus a new `boot/` adapter plus surgical cfg gates. There is no merge-conflict surface area worth managing serially.

The remainder of this ADR records six decisions (bootloader, DTB parsing, paging mode, timer source, interrupt controllers, per-CPU register), one strategic posture (generic-first, never board-specific), and one process commitment (tri-architecture regression discipline). It does not enumerate the implementation sequence — that is the plan file's job.

## Decisions

### Decision 1 — Bootloader: OpenSBI + custom S-mode stub now; CambiOS-native firmware long-term

RISC-V has no equivalent of Limine. The de-facto standard is a two-layer stack: an M-mode firmware (almost universally OpenSBI in production, shipped with QEMU as `-bios default`) loads an S-mode payload (Linux, BSD, or in our case CambiOS) and remains resident to provide the Supervisor Binary Interface (SBI) — a stable ecall-based ABI for things only M-mode can do (timer arming, IPI dispatch, hart start/stop).

**Decision:** CambiOS targets OpenSBI as the M-mode firmware on RISC-V for the foreseeable future. We do *not* write our own M-mode firmware. We do write a minimal S-mode boot stub at src/boot/riscv.rs that:

- Receives control from OpenSBI in S-mode with `a0 = hart_id` and `a1 = dtb_phys_addr`
- Parses the DTB enough to discover memory regions and core peripheral addresses (UART, PLIC, CLINT)
- Sets up a minimal Sv48 page table establishing identity map plus higher-half direct map (HHDM)
- Writes `satp` to enable paging
- Jumps through a virtual-address trampoline to higher-half `kmain`
- Populates a `BootInfo` via `boot::install()` so the rest of the kernel reads boot data through the existing protocol-agnostic seam

**Why OpenSBI rather than rolling our own M-mode firmware:**

- M-mode firmware is a hardware-quirk absorber, not an interesting design surface for a microkernel project. OpenSBI handles timer extension probing, hart enumeration, console putchar, system reset, RFENCE coordination — and does so portably across QEMU, SiFive silicon, StarFive silicon, T-Head silicon, and unannounced future RISC-V boards. Reimplementing that work would consume calendar time we owe to the kernel.
- The SBI ABI is stable, versioned (currently v2.0), and explicitly designed to be the OS↔firmware interface. Unlike UEFI on x86/ARM (which CambiOS plans to replace, per the camBIOS firmware roadmap), SBI is *not* a complex protocol for OS load — it is a thin syscall-like interface that we use *during normal kernel operation* for a small handful of services. Replacing SBI would mean writing M-mode timer drivers, M-mode IPI machinery, M-mode RFENCE coordination, and PMP/PMA configuration — all infrastructure with no CambiOS-distinguishing properties.
- OpenSBI is reproducible-buildable, audit-friendly (BSD-2-clause C, ~50K lines), and shipped pre-signed by upstream. We can pin a known-good OpenSBI binary the same way we pin a known-good Limine binary.

**Why a custom S-mode stub rather than a generic bootloader (U-Boot, GRUB):**

- The plan-file principle "build it generic, never board-specific" makes any production bootloader a poor fit — they all carry per-board configuration baggage. Our needs are tiny: parse DTB, set up paging, populate `BootInfo`, jump.
- Routing through the existing `boot::` abstraction means *no other kernel code changes* to accommodate RISC-V boot. The S-mode stub is a peer of `boot::limine::populate()`. This is exactly the seam the boot abstraction was designed for (src/boot/mod.rs).
- A custom stub keeps verification surface area small. U-Boot is ~1M lines of C; our stub is ~500 lines of Rust + assembly with bounded iteration and explicit invariants per the verification convention.

**Long-term posture:**

The camBIOS firmware roadmap (memory note `project_cambios_firmware`) commits CambiOS to its own UEFI replacement long-term. The RISC-V analogue would be a CambiOS-native M-mode firmware replacing OpenSBI. This is **deferred until target CambiOS hardware exists** — there is no reason to build an M-mode firmware for QEMU virt or for someone else's RISC-V board. When the project's own RISC-V hardware lands, the M-mode firmware question reopens. Until then, OpenSBI is the right choice.

### Decision 2 — DTB parsing: hand-rolled, bounded, minimal

OpenSBI hands us the physical address of a DeviceTree Blob (DTB, also called a Flattened Device Tree or FDT). The DTB is a structured binary describing the platform — memory regions, CPU cores, peripheral addresses, interrupt routing, and so on. There is no ACPI on RISC-V; the DTB is the canonical hardware enumeration mechanism.

**Decision:** the RISC-V boot stub includes a hand-rolled DTB parser (~250 lines, in src/boot/riscv.rs) that reads only the nodes the kernel needs:

- `/memory@*` — usable physical memory regions, mapped to `BootInfo::push_memory_region()` as `MemoryRegionKind::Usable`
- `/chosen` — initrd start/end if present (boot modules), `stdout-path` for console identification
- `/cpus` — hart identifiers and `timebase-frequency` for timer calibration
- Reserved-memory regions — the DTB itself, OpenSBI's address range (`0x80000000`–`0x80200000` on QEMU virt), our own kernel image range; all marked `MemoryRegionKind::Reserved`

Parsing follows the verification convention: bounded iteration (`MAX_DTB_NODES`, `MAX_DTB_DEPTH`), every variable-length read returns `Result`, no recursion, no panics. The parser is pure — it consumes a `&[u8]` and produces a `BootInfo`, with no side effects.

**Why hand-roll rather than use the `fdt` crate:**

- The `fdt` crate is well-tested but gives us a full DTB parser as a dependency — far more capability than we use. CambiOS's verification posture treats every external dependency as audit work owed; the `fdt` crate would land us tens of thousands of lines of parsing code under our trust boundary for the savings of a few hundred lines of writing.
- The minimum viable parser is small. The DTB binary format is straightforward: a header, a string table, and a token stream of `BEGIN_NODE` / `END_NODE` / `PROP` / `NOP` / `END`. A bounded recursive-descent parser fits in 250 lines including error handling.
- Hand-rolling forces familiarity with the format. RISC-V is the project's third architecture; the DTB is going to come up again — for runtime device discovery on future CambiOS RISC-V hardware, for ARM SBC support, for anything else that reuses the FDT format. Owning the parser is cheaper over the project's lifetime than depending on a crate that may eventually need a fork anyway.

The parser may be promoted to `src/dtb/` (out of `src/boot/riscv.rs`) when a second consumer appears.

### Decision 3 — Paging mode: Sv48

RISC-V S-mode supports four paging modes selectable via the `MODE` field in `satp`: `Bare` (no translation), `Sv39` (3 levels, 39-bit VA, 512 GiB address space), `Sv48` (4 levels, 48-bit VA, 256 TiB), and `Sv57` (5 levels, 57-bit VA, 128 PiB). All use 4 KiB base pages with optional megapage (2 MiB) and gigapage (1 GiB) leaves.

**Decision:** CambiOS targets Sv48 on RISC-V.

**Why Sv48:**

- Structural parity with x86_64 4-level paging and AArch64's existing 4-level Sv48-equivalent. CambiOS's shared paging module (src/memory/mod.rs:60+) already operates on a 4-level model under `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "x86_64"))]` — RISC-V slots in directly with only the PTE bit encoding differing from AArch64's descriptor format.
- 256 TiB of virtual address space is comfortably above any v1 workload and matches the address-space model the rest of the kernel assumes (HHDM at `0xffff_8000_0000_0000`-class offsets, kernel at `0xffff_ffff_8000_0000`).
- Sv48 is the universally-supported "real workload" paging mode on RISC-V hardware with MMUs. Sv39 exists for very small embedded systems; Sv57 exists for hyperscalers. CambiOS is targeting general-purpose computing across deployment tiers (per [ADR-009](/adr/009-purpose-tiers-scope/)), which is squarely Sv48 territory.

**Fallback:** if the Sv48 boot trampoline proves disproportionately fiddly during Phase R-1, we may temporarily land Sv39 as a stepping stone (smaller address space, identical structure minus one level). This is recorded as a risk in the plan file. The fallback is purely transitional — production CambiOS RISC-V is Sv48.

### Decision 4 — Timer: SBI ecall (`sbi_set_timer`), not direct CLINT MMIO

RISC-V supervisor-mode software has two ways to arm a per-hart timer: program the M-mode CLINT (Core Local Interruptor) MMIO directly, or call SBI's `sbi_set_timer` ecall and let M-mode do it.

**Decision:** CambiOS uses `sbi_set_timer`. The standard `time` CSR (readable from S-mode) gives us the current tick count; `sbi_set_timer(time + reload)` arms the next interrupt. Per-hart timer interrupt enable is via the `STIE` bit in `sie`.

**Why SBI rather than direct MMIO:**

- CLINT addresses and layouts vary across implementations. SBI normalizes this — the same code runs on QEMU virt, on SiFive silicon, on hypothetical future CambiOS RISC-V hardware, without per-platform CLINT bring-up code.
- The SBI Timer Extension is a stable, versioned interface. Direct CLINT access requires us to know whether we're running on a system with SSTC (Supervisor-mode Timer extension), which would let us arm the timer from S-mode without an ecall — but at the cost of an SSTC capability probe and a per-platform code path. Until SSTC is universal on CambiOS-relevant hardware, the SBI path is simpler.
- SBI also gives us `sbi_send_ipi` for cross-hart interrupts, used by Phase R-5 TLB shootdown. Reusing the same ABI for both is consistency we should not give up casually.

When CambiOS-native RISC-V hardware exists and we have eliminated OpenSBI in favor of a CambiOS M-mode firmware, this decision reopens — at that point we own both layers and direct CLINT/SSTC access becomes attractive.

### Decision 5 — Interrupt controllers: PLIC for devices, CLINT for timer + IPI

RISC-V splits interrupt handling between two MMIO units:

- **CLINT** (Core Local Interruptor) — per-hart timer interrupt and software interrupt (used for IPIs)
- **PLIC** (Platform-Level Interrupt Controller) — external (device) interrupts, routed to harts via priority-based claim/complete

**Decision:** CambiOS uses PLIC for device IRQs (network, block, console input) and CLINT-via-SBI for timer and IPIs. PLIC driver lives at src/arch/riscv64/plic.rs; CLINT operations are mediated through SBI per Decision 4 and so do not need a dedicated CLINT driver.

The PLIC operations CambiOS needs are minimal: `init()` (mask all sources, set hart context threshold to 0), `enable_irq(source_id, hart_context)` (set the per-hart enable bit), `claim() -> u32` (read claim register inside the trap handler when `scause` indicates external interrupt), `complete(source_id)` (write completion). All other PLIC features — preemption, priority levels, per-source priority tuning — are unused; CambiOS's interrupt model treats all device IRQs as equal-priority and dispatches via src/interrupts/routing.rs.

This matches CambiOS's existing pattern: AArch64 uses GICv3 with a similarly minimal driver surface; x86_64 uses APIC + IOAPIC ditto. The interrupt-routing layer is portable; the controller drivers are arch-specific and small.

### Decision 6 — Per-CPU pointer: `tp` register, swapped via `sscratch` on U→S trap

Every CambiOS arch needs a fast way to get from "current execution context" to the per-CPU `PerCpu` struct, including from inside a trap handler before the kernel stack is established. x86_64 uses GS base; AArch64 uses TPIDR_EL1.

**Decision:** RISC-V uses the `tp` (thread pointer, x4) register as the per-CPU pointer in S-mode. The RISC-V ABI reserves `tp` for thread-local storage and the compiler will not clobber it. On U→S trap entry, the trap handler executes `csrrw tp, sscratch, tp` — atomically swapping the user's `tp` with the kernel's per-CPU pointer that was pre-stashed in `sscratch`. On S→U return, the swap is reversed.

This is structurally identical to x86_64's `swapgs` mechanism: a CSR holds the kernel pointer while the user holds its own value in the GPR; a single instruction swaps them on the privilege boundary. AArch64 uses a different model (TPIDR_EL1 always holds the kernel pointer because user space cannot read it from EL0 without going through a system register), but the RISC-V `tp` is user-readable, so the swap is necessary.

`PerCpu` shape matches the existing AArch64 layout — `self_ptr`, `cpu_id`, `hardware_id` (here `hart_id`), `kernel_stack_top`, `current_task_id`, `interrupt_depth`. Every arch's `PerCpu` should keep this shape so portable code reads it uniformly.

## Strategic Posture: Generic-First, Never Board-Specific

The plan file commits to "generic first, board-specific never" for RISC-V. This ADR makes the same commitment formal: CambiOS RISC-V code targets *RISC-V standards*, not any specific board's quirks.

Concretely:

- **No SiFive-isms, no T-Head-isms, no StarFive-isms.** No code path keyed on a vendor's MIDR-equivalent CSR.
- **DTB-driven device discovery, no hardcoded MMIO addresses in code.** Even the QEMU virt UART address (`0x10000000`) is a default the boot stub uses only if the DTB does not name it; the DTB-named address always wins.
- **Standards-compliant transport: virtio-mmio (not vendor-specific), PLIC (not vendor extensions), SBI (not direct CLINT).** Where a RISC-V standard exists, we use it.

The reasoning is the bare-metal target: CambiOS's eventual RISC-V hardware will be project-designed and will conform to RISC-V standards by construction. Generic code is the code that runs on it. Code carrying a vendor's quirk burden is code we'd have to delete before bringing up our own silicon.

Where a board *requires* nonstandard handling, that handling lives in a future device-specific overlay (analogous to how Linux uses DTS overlays per board), not in the core arch backend. No such overlays exist today; if one becomes necessary, a follow-up ADR records the boundary.

## Process Commitment: Tri-Architecture Regression Discipline

Two backends could be sustained by occasionally running the other one. Three cannot.

**Decision:** `make check-all` builds all three kernels (x86_64, AArch64, riscv64) and is **mandatory** before every commit and as a CI gate when CI exists. Any commit that breaks any architecture is rejected. There is no "fix it on the next pass" — there is no next pass, because by the time the second arch breaks the first one has already drifted.

The Makefile target was added in Phase R-0:

```
make check-all      # builds all three
make check-x86      # x86_64 only
make check-aarch64  # AArch64 only
make check-riscv64  # riscv64 only
```

This ADR also commits to two structural conventions that reduce the cost of three backends:

- **Negated cfg when AArch64 + RISC-V share behavior.** The paging module at src/memory/mod.rs:60 already uses `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "x86_64"))]` for the 4-level Sv48-class implementation that both ARM and RISC-V want. This pattern auto-includes RISC-V without modification. Where all three diverge, use positive cfgs for all three.
- **When a 3-way cfg block emerges, factor.** Two-arch inline-asm cfg blocks become noisy at three. The right time to factor `arch::interrupts_enable()`, `arch::read_page_table_root()`, `arch::wait_for_interrupt()` helpers is when the third arm appears, not after the noise has accumulated.

## Implementation

The execution sequence is recorded in the plan file at `/Users/jasonricca/.claude/plans/melodic-tumbling-muffin.md`, not duplicated here. Phase markers (R-0 through R-6) appear in [STATUS.md](/docs/status/) as they land.

Critical files to be created (full list in the plan):

- src/arch/riscv64/ — backend implementing the contract documented in src/arch/mod.rs (mirror of src/arch/aarch64/)
- src/boot/riscv.rs — S-mode boot stub, DTB parser, Sv48 boot page table setup, populator for `boot::install()`
- linker-riscv64.ld — already created in Phase R-0
- user/hello-riscv64.S, user/user-riscv64.ld — user-space entry templates

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Three-architecture support with the kernel's existing portability ratio preserved (target ≥85%).
- Validates the `arch/` and `boot/` abstractions against a third independent backend — anywhere they accidentally encoded x86 or ARM assumptions becomes visible and fixable.
- Establishes RISC-V as a first-class CambiOS target, ready to absorb future project-designed RISC-V hardware without a port phase.

**Negative:**

- Build matrix triples. CI cost, local-test cost, and reviewer cognitive load all grow. The `make check-all` discipline plus the negated-cfg pattern keep this manageable but do not eliminate it.
- No bare-metal RISC-V validation possible until target hardware exists. All RISC-V testing is QEMU virt for the foreseeable future. This is acknowledged and acceptable given the "CambiOS-designed hardware" target — but it does mean RISC-V cannot claim "boot-tested on real silicon" for v1.
- Adds a long-running concurrent workstream against the v1 roadmap. Phase R-N progress tracking lands in [STATUS.md](/docs/status/) as each milestone passes.

**Reversibility:**

- The decision is reversible at any phase boundary by deleting `src/arch/riscv64/`, `src/boot/riscv.rs`, the linker script, and the four cfg gates added to lib.rs / main.rs / io / loader. No data structures change; no portable code is rewritten in a RISC-V-specific way. The build infrastructure additions (rust-toolchain target, .cargo/config.toml block, Makefile targets) are inert when removed.

## Open Questions

- **`riscv` crate vs hand-rolled CSR access.** Deferred to Phase R-1 when the first CSR write is written. Hand-rolled is leaning, for verification transparency matching how AArch64 accesses TPIDR_EL1 / VBAR_EL1 / SPSR_EL1 directly via inline asm. Decision recorded inline in `src/arch/riscv64/mod.rs` when made.
- **`BootProtocol` trait.** AP wakeup is currently Limine-specific in src/microkernel/main.rs's `start_application_processors()`. Phase R-5 forces the third arm in; at that point we choose between adding a third inline arch arm or factoring a `BootProtocol` trait. The trait would benefit camBIOS long-term anyway. Decision deferred to Phase R-5 review.
- **Eventual M-mode firmware.** OpenSBI is the right choice for now. Whether CambiOS eventually replaces it with a CambiOS-native M-mode firmware (the RISC-V analogue of replacing UEFI) reopens when CambiOS-designed RISC-V hardware exists. No work required before that.

## Divergence

### 2026-04-16 — Phase R-1 ships in low-memory layout; Sv48 trampoline deferred to R-2

**What changed.** Phase R-1 was originally scoped to deliver the serial-banner milestone *with* the Sv48 boot page table trampoline that establishes the HHDM and switches the kernel from its physical load address to a higher-half mapping at `0xffffffff80000000`. The plan file flagged this trampoline as "the single hardest piece of Phase R-1" and listed an explicit fallback in Risk #1: "If Sv48 proves hard, fall back temporarily to Sv39 ... or run without paging." During implementation we took the simpler half of that fallback: **R-1 runs with paging disabled, kernel linked at `0x80200000` (= the OpenSBI handoff address) physical = virtual.** linker-riscv64.ld carries the Phase R-1 layout; src/arch/riscv64/entry.rs does *not* set up Sv48 page tables, only a boot stack and the call into Rust. The `_start` → `kmain_riscv64` → `halt` path runs entirely in physical address space.

**Why.** The Sv48 trampoline is a self-contained piece of work that naturally co-locates with frame-allocator init and the shared paging module's RISC-V PTE bit constants — all of which are Phase R-2 deliverables. Front-loading it into R-1 would have made R-1 substantially larger without unblocking anything (the banner-milestone goal doesn't need paging). Splitting it into R-2 keeps R-1's testable surface narrow (boot stack + UART driver + Rust entry) and lands paging in the phase where the rest of the memory subsystem is being built.

**How to apply.** Phase R-2 now owns: (a) the Sv48 boot page table trampoline (identity map for the boot path + HHDM + higher-half kernel map), (b) the `satp` write that enables paging, (c) the linker script revision putting VMA at `0xffffffff80000000` with LMA via `AT(0x80200000)`. The shared paging module work in src/memory/mod.rs (RISC-V PTE bit constants, `satp`-based `active_page_table()`) was already R-2 scope; the trampoline joins it.

This deviation is reversible — restoring the original "Sv48 in R-1" plan would only require swapping the linker script and adding the boot trampoline. No Phase R-1 code becomes wrong; the entry stub and `kmain_riscv64` continue to work unchanged once paging is added underneath them.

### 2026-04-16 — Pre-existing TryRecvMsg dispatch bug surfaced and fixed during R-1

**What changed.** Adding the third architecture forced a fresh-cache build of the kernel crate, which surfaced an existing non-exhaustive-match error: `SyscallNumber::TryRecvMsg = 37` had been added to src/syscalls/mod.rs but never wired to a dispatcher arm. The bug was hidden on x86 and AArch64 by stale incremental compilation — both arches *also* failed on a clean build. Fixed in src/syscalls/dispatcher.rs by adding a `handle_try_recv_msg` non-blocking handler (mirrors `handle_recv_msg` minus the block-and-yield loop; returns `Ok(0)` on empty queue).

**Why this matters for the ADR.** The fix is unrelated to the RISC-V port itself but the port surfaced it, which is exactly the kind of cross-arch-discipline outcome ADR-013 § Process Commitment ("Tri-Architecture Regression Discipline") predicts. Recording it here so future sessions reading this ADR understand why a pre-existing dispatcher arm appeared in the same change set as the RISC-V scaffolding.

### 2026-04-16 — Phase R-2 landing notes (Sv48 trampoline, DTB overlay model, portable reservation pass, R-2.d deferral)

**Phase R-2 delivered** the full memory subsystem — Sv48 boot page table trampoline, higher-half kernel at `0xffffffff80200000`, hand-rolled DTB parser, frame allocator + kernel heap init, `Box::new` end-to-end round-trip. Four points worth recording for future maintainers:

**(1) Boot trampoline — long jump to higher-half.** The `_start` assembly in src/arch/riscv64/entry.rs calls a Rust helper (`riscv64_fill_boot_page_tables`) to populate the three static page tables (1 L3 root, 1 L2_IDENTITY shared between L3[0] and L3[256] for HHDM, 1 L2_KERNEL with a single gigapage at L2[510] for the kernel map). It then writes `satp` and does the transition via a `.quad kmain_riscv64` in `.rodata` — loading the absolute VMA `0xffffffff802XXXXX` through a PC-relative-addressable physical load *before* paging flips on, then `jr`ing to that loaded address *after* `satp` + `sfence.vma`. `la kmain_riscv64` would not reach — the 32-bit pcrel displacement from physical `0x80200000` can't span to `0xffffffff802XXXXX`. This idiom should be reused for any future boot-time jump to higher-half on RISC-V.

**(2) DTB "full RAM + overlay reservations" model conflicts with existing heap init.** Limine delivers separate non-overlapping Usable/non-Usable regions; the x86/AArch64 `init_kernel_heap` happily picks the largest Usable and starts allocating at its base. The RISC-V DTB path populates BootInfo as "4 GiB Usable region + overlay reservations for OpenSBI / DTB / kernel image" — if `init_kernel_heap` picks `0x80000000` as base it collides with OpenSBI's PMP-protected range and the heap init's first write traps to a zero `stvec`, hanging the boot. Fixed by making `init_kernel_heap` overlay-aware: sort non-Usable overlays by base, skip past each, or clamp to the first gap large enough to hold the heap. Added a parallel pass in `init_frame_allocator` that reserves every non-Usable region as a belt-and-suspenders. Both are *portable improvements* — no-ops on x86/AArch64 today, and naturally correct when a future boot adapter chooses to emit BootInfo in either shape.

**(3) FDT field-order bug in our parser surfaced during R-2.b.** First implementation read `size_dt_struct` at header offset 32 and `size_dt_strings` at offset 36. Per Devicetree Spec v0.4 §5.2 the assignment is reversed: offset 32 is `size_dt_strings`, offset 36 is `size_dt_struct`. Our sanity check (`strings_end <= totalsize`) then failed because we were adding the struct-block size to the strings offset. Fixed and documented inline; the comment above the header read now calls out the easy-to-swap ordering explicitly. No observable behaviour change for valid DTBs — if the spec-defined offsets are read correctly, the parser advances through the whole blob without issue.

**(4) R-2.d (shared paging module RISC-V PTE arm) deferred.** The plan scoped R-2 to include "RISC-V PTE bit constants in shared paging module, `satp`-based `active_page_table()`." Neither is consumed in R-2 itself — the boot trampoline has its own hardcoded PTE bits (legitimately so; it runs pre-paging), the frame allocator doesn't touch PTEs, and the kernel heap uses HHDM (already mapped). The consumers of the shared paging module are `early_map_mmio()` (Phase R-3 for PLIC) and process page-table creation (Phase R-4). Per the project's "skip test hooks when next step consumes" feedback memory, we do not add compile-only arms ahead of their first real consumer. R-3 and R-4 will add the RISC-V PTE encoding to `src/memory/mod.rs` when they land. This deviation is recorded in the STATUS.md R-phase track with pointer to this note.
